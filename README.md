# Practical-Machine-Learning-Project
Hi guys! Thank you for downloading my code and compiled html. This is my course project for the online course Practical Machine Learning by The Johns Hopkins University.
Also thank you very much for your viewing, and I am very grateful if you could help me point out the strength and weakness of my coding.
If you have any suggestions or query, please contact me at ziyuye@live.com.
Good luck for your machine learning journey! :)
